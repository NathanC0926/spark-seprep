**Bug in Podman (Version 5.0.0):**
- Upon initiating the assignment, i discovered that Podman version 5.0.0 has a critical bug. This bug rendered it impossible to run images on my machine.
- To address this, I had to uninstall podman 5.0.0 and reinstall podman 5.0.2 on my machine.

**Missing several packages to use the model:**
- My machine didn't have several essential packages required for self-hosting the LLM.
- Additionally, my current Python version wasn't compatible with the LLM and its dependencies.
- Thus, I upgraded Python to a version compatible with the LLM and its associated dependencies.
